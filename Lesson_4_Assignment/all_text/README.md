This Assignment includes extract corpus from wiki Chinese, and word2vec. The main packages used are 
hanziconv(traditional chinese to simplified Chinese), jieba (word cutting for Chinese), gensim(word2vec).

Unfortunately, jupyter notebook cannot handle the large txt file when running gensim word2vec, I used Pycharm
to run rest of code. It works well. Please take my main.py script and run in Pycharm environment. Thanks.
